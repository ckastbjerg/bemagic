        #### Theming
    
        The \`block\` supports [\`theming\`](../CONVENTIONS.md) and can change its
        appearance when paired with the \`prefix-theme\` class.
        Note however, that themes may apply only for parts of the component.

        \`\`\`html
        <div class=\"block prefix-theme\">…</div>
        <!-- or using nesting -->
        <div class=\"prefix-theme\">
            <div class=\"block\">…</div>
        </div>
        \`\`\`
        <sub>See the [Component Overview](#component-overview) for more details.</sub>
